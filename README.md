# Information

Cappuccino was a well-known paid script in [Iron Man Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/1735775055/Iron-Man-Simulator) for its overpowered features.
However, due to Synapse X partnering with Roblox, we will no longer be continuing this version of Cappuccino.
For more information on the return of Cappuccino, please join our [discord](https://discord.gg/U2u29MEVZs).

# FAQ

### Does this version work?

No, it won't work on other exploits because it uses Synapse X functions. You can make a fork and fix it for the exploit you have.

### Why is x removed from the source?

Certain features may be exclusively to paid users. Others might have been removed at the request of one of our developers.
